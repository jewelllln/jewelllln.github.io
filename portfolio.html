				  <b>1.1.9 Project:</b> 
				  For our project, we created an underwater scene with a rock, sand, octopus, jellyfish, crab, starfish, kelp, a treasure chest, and bubbles. When you run the code, bubbles float to the top and then an orange fish appears. It swims across the screen, hits a shark, and turns into a big fish.

				  <b>1.2.5 Project:</b> 
				  For our game, we made a mouse and cheese hangman game. It displays a mouse, cheese, number of guesses, and correctly guessed letters on a city background.The user has up to 15 guesses for the entire word. When they guess a letter correctly, the mouse moves towards the cheese and the user still has 15 guesses left. If the letter is incorrect, the mouse doesn’t move and the number of guesses decreases. If a letter is guessed twice, the program will say “letter is already guessed!”
